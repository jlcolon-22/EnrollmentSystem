				<p class="text-center"> 
					It was not too long ago when Mr. Teodoro M. Luansing had a vision, a dream, to establish a school in Rosario, the first of its kind, as a tribute to the place and its people whom he had learned to love and whose memories he would finally cherish all his life. In June 2005-2006, the dream of Mr. Teodoro M. Luansing has turned into a reality. The college, the first ever in the eastern town of Batangas, situated at Barangay Namunga, near the crossroads along National Highway in Rosario, and traversing the towns of Padre Garcia, San Juan, Taysan and Ibaan was inaugurated. This ushered the advent of collegiate education in these areas whose youths have been commuting to Batangas City, Lipa City, and to as far as Manila just to avail of the services of their colleges and universities. The establishments of the college meant lots of savings in terms of money and efforts for the students enrolled in TMLCR. The college soon offered scholarships for those students belonging to the marginalized sector and on S.Y. 2016-2017, the Senior High School department became available at the college. As of now, TMLCR continues the Founder's vision of providing quality but affordable education, with which the institution has more than 70% scholars enrolled and has a student market that is 50% below the poverty level.
